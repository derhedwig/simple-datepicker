# simple-datepicker
A simple datepicker I wrote from scratch for a project. Works for me. Maybe of use for someone else.

## Features:
 * German Dates and Texts only
 * No js dependencies
 * Uses tailwind css classes
 * Respects min attribute on input
 * Keyboard support

## Usage:
Needs a lot of static markup.
See [example.html](/src/example.html).
